    question:
      "Are my donations to CHF including Vantiga tax-deductible in the United States?",
    answer:
      "Since CHF is recognized by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization (EIN 20-2738955), donations and Vantiga to it are tax-deductible. However, please check with your tax consultant for the specific deductions that would apply in your specific case.",

    id: 2,
    question:
      "What is the correct amount of Vantiga I need to pay per year to the Math?",
    answer:
      "Our revered H.H. Shrimat Anandashram Swamiji said – 'If all paid Vantiga at the rate of 1% of their income, the daily as well as occasional services at the Maths could be performed without any anxiety and the sadhana contemplated by us could be accomplished with peace of mind.' CHF recommends considering donations at the following suggested levels: Vantiga at 1% of your annual income or at a minimum of $1.50/day. Further, donations for special projects in any amount are welcome.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question:
      "Do I always have to login (join) CHF when accessing the CHF website?",
    answer:
      "Our CHF website at www.chfusa.org has member-specific content available for you. Such content will be of use for any and all Bhanaps in the US. The benefits of enrolling in the CHF USA website include receiving newsletters, getting invites to CHF events, downloading donation receipts, processing donations with minimal data entry, and accessing a directory of members (coming soon). Membership is restricted to Bhanaps for security.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question:
      "How do I specify the particular project to which I want to donate?",
    answer:
      "The donation page on the CHF website allows you to specify the manner in which you want to split the donated amount between various projects, support-a- student, vantiga or general fund. CHF recommends that you consider donations at the following suggested levels. Support A Student at $300/year per student supported. Vantiga at 1% of your Annual Income or at a minimum of $1.50/day",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question:
      "When and how (media) will I receive a receipt for my CHF donation?",
